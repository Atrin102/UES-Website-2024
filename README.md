# UES-Website-2024
UES Website for the 2023-24 Year

ðŸ‘‹ Intro
Hey! Thanks for checking out the Github repo for the UES website. This website is entirely scripted with CSS and HTML. Javascript is also included to make the site more interactive but is not needed (static site w/o JS). However, if you wish to purchase an item from the shop, Javascript needs to be enabled.

ðŸ“„ Survey
If you liked the site or did not like the site, be sure to fill out this feedback survey to let us know, it would be greatly appreciated!

ðŸ”§ Tools
Google Analytics is used on the site to track the number of visitors and Shopify Buy Button is used for the store. If you wish to opt out of Google Analytics, visit this website for an official extension to do so.

Any updates should go through the communications VP.
